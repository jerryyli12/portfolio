		<h2>Proposition: Global temperatures are continuing to rise at a high, unabated rate, with no evidence of

				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>For this visualization, one of my persuasive design choices was in rescaling the y-axis. The
					raw data provides changes in temperature relative to the <b>1951-1980</b> baseline. However, when I
					left
					the data unmodified, few of the bars are negative, and there doesn't feel to be a real "uh-oh"
					impact to the reader - the trend is just upward throughout. I noted that the temperature baseline -
					aka the "zero point" - is a somewhat arbitrary choice. Hence, by computing the 1961-1990 mean
					and
					readjusting the data to be based on a new, higher baseline, there is now a swing from negative bars
					to positive ones. By combining this graphical inversion with appropriately colored bars, the upward
					trend
					to me feels much more pressing. I'd score this 1.5 on the deceptiveness scale, as I feel that the
					zero
					point is a choice that must be made, and it doesn't really mislead the reader in an excessive way.
				</li>
				<li>There are two other design choices which I'll combine together here, because they have a somewhat
					similar effect. The first is the coloring of the bars, and the second is the choice to include a
					moving average. Note that in both cases, the information being provided is a bit redundant. The
					colors tell the same story as the bar lengths, and the moving average can be "imagined" by the
					reader. However, I nonetheless feel that these are effective visual encodings because they more
					easily allow the
					reader to comprehend the trend. The colors are chosen, of course, according to a conventional scale
					of cold to hot, so the change from deep blue to deep red drives home the global warming message.
					Meanwhile, since the variance in annual temperatures is high, the moving average makes the trend
					easier to see, and also offers a comparison for the projection described below. I'd score both of
					these choices 2 on the deceptiveness scale - there is no deceptive intent here.</li>
				<li>Another design choice was to augment the original data with a projection of global temperatures made
					by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1990. To drive home the point made in the
					title ("alarming rate") I felt that there needed to be something more than just an increasing series
					of bars. What would make it more "alarming" is if the increase were exceeding previous projections;
					hence, I included a reference line for the projected temperature increase from 1990 onward. There
					are two minor sources of potential deception here. First, the projection did call for a 0.3°C rise
					per decade, but admitted a large uncertainty range: 0.2°C to 0.5°C per decade. The means that the
					actual rise in temperature isn't meaningfully greater than originally hypothesized. The second is
					more subtle: I think it's a bit unfair to be able to pick an arbitrary projection ex post facto,
					since I'd
					only choose to include a projection that underestimated temperatures. For these reasons, I'd score
					this design choice a -0.5 in deceptiveness.
				</li>
				<li>Finally, a minor choice to mention is the aspect ratio, which, as discussed in lecture, can make a
					big impact on the perception of the data. In this case, I pushed the guideline only slightly,
					banking the trend to (approximately) just over 45 degrees. I'd score this -0.5 in terms of
					deceptiveness.</li>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The key persuasive - and admittedly deceptive - design choice in this visualization was to divide
					the data into
					8-year cycles. The purpose of this, of course, was to try to emphasize a "trend" in the data which
					occurred by pure chance, while downplaying and obfuscating the overall, genuine trend. I made this
					design
					choice because, while initially exploring the data, I realized that - purely due to variance - the
					global temperatures in 2007 and 2015 were abnormally high. Hence, I realized that, by plotting
					temperatures in 8-year periods relative to the first year in each period, I could conveniently
					portray the most recent periods (2007-2014 and 2015-2022) as actually having seen decreases in
					temperature, while previous periods were increasing. Of course, this is deceptive for two critical
					reasons: first, it cherry picks specific years to manufacture the trend. Second, the plot now has an
					"off-by-one" error in the sense that the changes from 2014-2015, 2006-2007, etc. are never
					visualized. But, if I could conveniently explain why I chose 8-year cycles, I felt that this
					deception could potentially fly under the radar for some readers, especially since using cycles is a
					common way to adjust for seasonality. Hence, this design choice scores a -2 for deceptiveness.</li>
				<li>The next design choice is a follow-up to the previous: I needed a way to explain why I chose 8-year
					cycles. I decided to explain it away using El Niño/La Niña, which is a legitimate weather phenomena
					affecting global temperatures
					occuring in cycles of between 1 and 8 years. I decided to explicitly mention this in the subtitle as
					well as citing a (again legitimate) source explaining the cyclical nature of El Niño/La Niña. Of
					course, while citing sources is an earnest design technique, the way I did so was purely deceptive,
					again earning a score of -2.</li>
				<li>Another critical design choice was to use an animated, rather than static, visualization for maximum
					persuasiveness. I think the animation is much more persuasive because the reader can clearly see the
					lines one at a time, realizing that the last two are lower than the others. Delineating the trend
					<em>over time (i.e. between different cycles)</em> is more difficult in the static visualization
					shown. A related design choice was the color scheme, with more recent lines shown in a darker blue.
					While the colors themselves do not encode anything about the temperatures, they may subconsciously
					hint to the reader of a cooling trend due to the deeper and deeper blue hues. I'd score the choice
					of using an animation a 2 in terms of deceptiveness - the deceptiveness of the graph as a whole
					aside, using animation is a completely valid mechanism to make my point - and the choice of colors a
					1.
				</li>
				<li>Finally, there were a couple other very minor (but conscious) design choices. Note that the y-axis
					is just slightly asymmetric, with a range of -0.5 to 0.6. Additionally, note that I emphasized the
					zero-point on the y-axis grid. Both of these choices make the "anomalous" 2007-2014 and 2015-2022
					periods
					look more different from the rest, further persuading the reader that indeed, things are changing
					and temperatures are no
					longer rising in recent years. I'd score these choices a 2 in terms of deceptiveness as they are
					completely valid, conventional design decisions which do not really mislead the reader but only
					serve to emphasize my message.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Final Reflection</h2>
			<p>Overall, I felt that this was a very interesting exercise in data visualization, as I've never thought
				about how to use deceptive design choices before. In the choice of my specific dataset and proposition,
				I was forced to challenge myself to come up with novel persuasive methods, since there is only one
				logical interpretation
				and trend in the data (well, to most people). Hence, while I found it fairly straightforward to make a
				visualization supporting my proposition (generally, drawing from past experience and knowledge of
				conventional techniques was sufficient), it was of course much more difficult to manufacture a trend
				where there was none in order to argue the opposing side. Nonetheless, I was suprised that it's actually
				very possible to distort the data (even without egregious lies/errors) to say what you want it to say.
			</p>
			<p>
				While I am still not sure I can draw solid bounds between acceptable persuasive choices and misleading
				ones, one thing that I noticed through the course of doing this assignment is that, when trying to
				persuade in earnest, design
				choices came naturally and logically from the trends I observed. In constrast, when trying to deceive, I
				had to wrangle the data to fit my predispositions and make forced design decisions. So, to me,
				misleading choices can be identified by the following assertion: when the data is being led by the
				author rather than the author being led by the data. Admittedly, this assertion is somewhat idealistic
				and difficult to distinguish in practice, but this reflects the blurry lines of reality. Nevertheless, I
				feel that this assignment and reflection may better help me identify when others - or even myself -
				start crossing the line into deceptive design choices.
