			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>

			<p>For this phase, I propose a broad motivating question: how has the US population distribution changed
				from 1900 to 2000, and do the changes differ by gender?</p>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>This type of visualization was the first to come to mind, as it's a common and effective way to
					depict a population distribution. The reader can clearly see the distribution over both age and
					gender.</li>
				<li>I chose to include 1900 and 2000 on the same plot to depict the change over time, using an absolute
					x-axis. This allows the reader
					to see the absolute change in each bin, while still allowing the individual distributions to be
					seen.</li>
				<li>Overall, I think this sketch is very effective and helps answer my question: the US population is
					aging, with much more of the population concentrated in the "middle-age" area. Two areas where this
					visualization falls short is that the absolute (un-normalized) x-axis makes it difficult to compare
					percentages, which the reader is probably more interested in instead. The second is that it's hard
					to see differences in gender here, as the distributions really aren't that different. These issues
					were the target focus of my second sketch.</li>
			</ul>

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>In this sketch, I hoped to focus exclusively on relative (i.e. percent) changes in the distribution.
					I also hoped to see clearer differences by gender.</li>
				<li>This visualization is able to communicate what age groups (and of which genders) increased the most
					in population relative to each other. And, if the reader is interested in comparing changes by
					gender, it's easier to do so as they are directly adjacent (rather than having to compare
					non-adjacent bars in the first sketch).</li>
				<li>However, this sketch lost a lot of information pertinent to the original question. While we can see
					the change in the population distribution, we cannot see either of the individual distributions from
					1900 or 2000, nor can we see any absolute figures/changes. Moreover, as we discussed in lecture,
					color saturation is probably not the most effective mark to use here, making this visualization
					harder to read than the bars of sketch 1. Hence, for the last sketch, I decided to
					revisit a closer design to sketch 1 while keeping the lessons from sketch 2 in mind.</li>
			</ul>

					colors, but this isn't an option on Notability.

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>For this sketch, I wanted to try to normalize the distributions so the reader can more easily make
					relative comparisons between 1900 and 2000. I also decided to omit gender, as I wanted to focus on
					the age distribution.</li>
				<li>This visualization does the job, clearly allowing the reader to answer a question such as "how much
					more of the population is of retirement age in 2000 vs. 1900"?</li>
				<li>Nonetheless, I still felt flaws with this visualization. The circular shape is a debatable choice,
					since age is not truly cyclic (though you could argue something about the "circle of life" here).
					Moreover, the circular marks simply felt much more difficult to read; it's a lot harder to compare
					between, say, the 0-4 age group and the 45-49 age group compared to sketch 1.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Reflection</h3>

			<p>
				In summary, I sketched three different designs, a population pyramid, a heatmap, and a radial pie chart.
				The population pyramid is generally easy to read and to make comparisons (especially between age
				groups),
				and it also shows the population distributions for both 1900 and 2000, which can help the reader draw
				additional observations. However, it lacks in showing relative differences over time due to the absolute
				x-axis. The heatmap was the solution to clearly show relative differences, so the reader could easily
				answer something like "is more of the population today composed of adults than in 1900?" However, the
				heatmap lost much of the important information, such as the individual population distributions
				themselves, and the choice of mark made it difficult to read. Finally, the radial pie chart was a move
				back toward sketch 1, but now still allowing the reader to easily make normalized, relative comparisons
				between 1900
				and 2000. However, like sketch 2, I felt it was more difficult to read and made some comparisons between
				age groups more difficult. Hence, my general thought going into the next phase was to follow the general
				design of sketch 1, while potentially synthesizing some aspects of the latter two sketches to improve
				upon it.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
				For the final visualization, I decided to focus in on a more specific question than before: how much
				older is the US population growing? Essentially, I wanted to make a visualization which best showed how
				the population age distribution has changed, with much more of the population being middle-age and older
				adults, and much less of the population being children. I chose to use a type of visualization commonly
				known as a population pyramid, which is essentially two bar charts facing opposite directions. This is
				the best choice for the data because of the binned age variable and the fact that bars
				are the most effective mark for comparison across age bins. The reader can clearly see which age groups
				are more or less represented in the population, enabling the identification of historical baby
				booms. Furthermore, I chose to use two separate
				facets for the temporal variable, 1900 vs. 2000. This is because, in my opinion, it is the best way to
				allow for both relative and absolute comparison across time (the x-axis displays absolute values, and
				the reader can see the relative shapes of the distributions clearly). Even at a brief glance, the reader
				can immediately see that much more of the population in 2000 is comprised of middle-age adults, rather
				than being predominantly children as in 1900. In terms of more minor design choices, I opted to use
				a common
				y-axis to make reading the visualization seamless. Keeping a linear scale for the x-axis and sorting the
				age bins are
				additional common-sense choices for the data.
			</p>
			<p>
				Despite these design efforts, my visualization does obscure and/or ineffectively represent some aspects
				of the data. Firstly, comparison between gender is difficult. As we discussed in lecture, humans are
				not very good at comparing bar lengths with separate x-axes, which the reader is forced to do for
				comparing male and female bars. I accepted this as a "flaw" because I decided to focus on age, rather
				than gender, for my visualization.
				The second issue is that the x-axis scale between the facets are
				different.
				This means that, if the reader is not careful, they may not realize that the bars on the right actually
				represent approximately 2.5x more people than the bars on the left, reflecting the large overall
				increase in the US population. I also accepted this as a "flaw" because I again wanted to focus on the
				change in the population <em>distribution</em>, not the absolute population numbers. Using a different
				scale for the x-axis enables the quick <em>relative</em> observations aforementioned.

			<h3>Reflection</h3>

			<p>
				Sketching definitely helped me brainstorm for the final design. Coming in, I knew that a
				population pyramid like sketch 1 would probably be the most effective, and sketch 1 definitely
				reinforced to me its effectiveness. However, my initial population
				pyramid sketch also helped me notice some flaws in the design, such as the difficulty in making relative
				comparisons between 1900 and 2000, as well as the ineffective representation of differences between
				gender. The heatmap was an attempt to address both of these issues, but ultimately lost too much of the
				original
				information and readability. It helped me realize that I ought to redirect my motivating question on age
				rather than
				trying to tackle both on age and gender together. Finally, the radial pie chart gave me insights into
				how I should make
				relative comparisons in the population distribution from 1900 to 2000 easy. It led me to realize that,
				while I wanted to use a normalized, shared scale for both the 1900 and 2000 distributions,
				plotting them on top of each other was not the most effective choice. Ultimately, these observations led
				me to my final visualization, where I kept most of the aspects from sketch 1, but faceted the pyramid
				temporally due to my observations from my additional sketches.
