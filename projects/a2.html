			<h2>Subtheme: Exclusionary Zoning</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Which regions in Boston have the most exclusionary zoning? This question is motivated by the New
					York Times visualizations, which show the single-family zoning in other cities across the US, and
					it's
					also generally the primary focus of this subtheme.</li>
				<li>How do demographics differ in areas zoned for single-family housing vs. not; e.g., who is being
					"excluded" by exclusionary zoning? The provided reading "Exclusionary by Design" argues that zoning
					has, throughout history, been used as a tool of race and class exclusion in Boston. With this
					question, I hope to determine if the data continues to support this argument.</li>
				<li>Where might there be the best opportunities for upzoning? This question is motivated by personal
					interest and past experience. In 11.001, my group visited Alewife - the terminus of the red line -
					and argued in favor of transit-oriented, affordable development in the area. I'm curious what the
					data says regarding opportunities for upzoning in this region and in others in Boston.

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

					To get a general sense of the data and to begin to understand what regions of Boston have the most
					exclusionary zoning, this first visualization simply plots the percentage of residential land which
					is zoned only for single-family homes in each municipality. It's clear that from municipality to
					municipality, the zoning differs substantially, with some municipalities zoned entirely for
					single-family homes but others with no exclusionary zoning. At first, I was concerned of a data
					quality issue due to the zero values. However, examining the original MAPC data source informed me
					that - aside from a strange Lynnfield observation - the zero values are likely correct, with those
					municipalities
					allowing for multifamily developments by special permit. I've also used color to indicate MBTA
					communities, as this is an interesting direction to investigate later - for now, what we see is that
					the vast majority of Boston municipalities are serviced by the MBTA.

					Inspired by the New York Times graphics, this map shows, spatially, the regions zoned for
					single-family homes only vs. not. It's an interesting visualization to me because Boston's
					exclusionary zoning appears less "structured" than other cities. In a broad statement, it appears
					that individual municipalities have reasonable jurisdiction over their zoning, so neighboring
					municipalities can have very different zoning and overall trends are
					not immediately clear. However, some standard observations
					do emerge. The downtown areas are generally zoned to allow multifamily units, as well as small
					pockets
					in the suburbs, presumably higher-density town and transit centers.

					Now, we begin investigating the demographic data. This first set of three charts plots the
					distributions of household income, ethnicity, and age in the Boston area. The goal of this
					visualization is to help understand the data distribution and serves primarily as a data quality
					check. We see that the income distribution seems to reasonably reflect reality, with a large
					increase around the minimum wage mark, and otherwise a somewhat normal distribution with the right
					tail bucketed together. Likewise, the ethnicity and age distributions are as expected, affirming
					that no severe data quality issues are present. I've also colored the charts by areas zoned for
					single-family
					vs. not, but again this is mostly for a data
					quality check. Now, what we really want to clearly visualize is how these distributions differ in
					single-family zones vs. otherwise.

				<figcaption>
					This set of three charts is similar to the previous one, plotting the income, ethnicity, and age
					distributions. However, here I've separated it out by single-family zoning vs. not, and normalized
					them to visualize only the proportions. Now, the differing demographics are clearly shown. In the
					first chart, we see that areas zoned exclusively for single-family homes have higher household
					incomes (lower proportion of low incomes and higher proportion of high incomes). In the second
					chart, we see that exclusionary zoning disproportionately affects African-American and Latino
					populations, and the white population is much higher in single-family zones. The age distribution
					generally shows more working-age people in non-exclusionary zones, which is logical. Given these
					observations, what I wanted to know now was whether this trend of low-income, African-American and
					Latino populations being disproportionately affected by exclusionary zoning held across
					municipalities, or whether the observations here were the result of a few particular areas
					(Simpson's paradox).

					To answer my question, I first generated a new measure of the percentage of households below the
					poverty line (this is a bit of rough estimate - I used 25k, the poverty line for a household of 3).
					I then plotted this measure across municipalities, split by single-family vs. not. What we can see
					from the charts on the left is that, indeed, the trend of wealthier people in single-family zones
					holds across municipalities - not just overall. Likewise, I created a measure of the percentage of
					African-American and Latino population in each municipality; the trend of fewer such people in
					single-family zones also
					holds across municipalities. Therefore, we can start to reasonably argue that lower-income,
					African-American and Hispanic people are the ones most affected by exclusionary zoning, which
					reaffirms previous research.

				<figcaption>
					To address my final question, I decided to introduce a measure not immediately apparent in the
					original dataset: municipality area. This simply required imputing the area based on the provided
					geometry. This chart plots the results, primarily as a data quality check (I did this first in
					Tableau, which incorrectly imputed area for several municipalities) - indeed, manual checks with
					Google and Google Maps confirms that areas are accurate.

				<figcaption>
					With area, this allows us to calculate the measure that I'm after: population density. This chart
					plots the population density of municipalities, separated by exclusionary zoning, just as I did with
					the demographic data. We can see that areas zoned for single-family homes only are less dense than
					those which are not. This confirms the basic observation that zoning which allows multifamily units
					increases density.

				<figcaption>
					We've now seen that multifamily zoning is correlated with higher diversity in terms of income and
					ethnicity. We've also seen that multifamily zoning is correlated with higher density. This
					visualization connects the loop back to affordable housing: does building denser actually correlate
					to more
					affordability? This dataset doesn't provide housing price data, but we can use incomes as a proxy -
					if more lower income people live in the area, then it's likely to be more affordable. We see that,
					indeed, higher density correlates to more diversity in income, with a larger percentage of the
					population having lower incomes. An interesting observation is that - as seen in the second and
					third charts - this trend holds not only overall, but even <em>when controlling for the zoning
						type</em>, i.e. building denser - even if already not zoned for single-family only - is still
					potentially beneficial.
				</figcaption>

				<img src="a2_images/vis9.png" alt="" width="70%" />
				<figcaption>
					And now finally, let's take a stab at the question: where might be the best opportunities for
					upzoning? There are obviously many ways to approach this - most of which are beyond the scope of
					this dataset and exercise. As a first attempt, I've filtered municipalities by ones which currently
					use
					exclusionary zoning and which are considered MBTA communities, as communities near transit would
					benefit the most from upzoning. Then, in the chart I've plotted municipalities sorted by population
					density - as this is a (very) rough metric for needing more housing - and colored by percentage
					below the
					poverty line - as this is a rough metric for affordability. Then, we can see that the
					exclusionary-zoned areas in Revere, Watertown, Arlington, etc. might benefit the most from upzoning,
					due to their high densities and high incomes (and yet their refusal to allow multifamily
					developments).

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>In summary, this exploratory visual analysis serves as a preliminary investigation into the Boston
				single-family zoning dataset. I first found that - unlike in other cities - Boston's single-family zoned
				areas are less patterned spatially, and the amount of land zoned for single-family homes differs wildly
				from municipality to municipality. I then observed that exclusionary zoning in Boston disproportionately
				affects lower-income, African-American and Latino populations. The trend held overall and across
				individual municipalities. Furthermore, I established that areas in Boston which allow multifamily
				development are higher
				in density, and that higher density correlates with more diversity in income - even when controlling for
				the zoning type. Finally, by looking at exclusionary-zoned MBTA communities with high income and high
				density, I took a first step toward understanding where upzoning might help most.</p>
